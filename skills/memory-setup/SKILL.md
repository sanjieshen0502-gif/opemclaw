# Memory Setup Skill

Transform your agent from goldfish to elephant. This skill helps configure persistent memory for OpenClaw.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Original skill targeted `clawdbot/moltbot`. Config path adapted for OpenClaw.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create Memory Structure

In your workspace, create:

```
workspace/
├── MEMORY.md          # Long-term curated memory
└── memory/
    ├── logs/          # Daily logs (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
    ├── projects/      # Project-specific context
    ├── groups/        # Group chat context
    └── system/        # Preferences, setup notes
```

### 2. Initialize MEMORY.md

Create `MEMORY.md` in workspace root:

```markdown
# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## About [User Name]
- Key facts, preferences, context

## Active Projects
- Project summaries and status

## Decisions & Lessons
- Important choices made
- Lessons learned

## Preferences
- Communication style
- Tools and workflows
```

### 3. (Optional) Enable Memory Search

Add to `openclaw.json` if you want semantic memory search (requires API key):

```json
{
  "memorySearch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "voyage",
    "sources": ["memory", "sessions"],
    "indexMode": "hot",
    "minScore": 0.3,
    "maxResults": 20
  }
}
```

> **Note:** OpenClaw already has built-in `memory_search` and `memory_get` tools. This config enables semantic (embedding-based) search, which requires a provider like Voyage AI or OpenAI.

## Provider Options

| Provider | Description | API Key Required |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| voyage | Voyage AI embeddings (recommended) | Yes |
| openai | OpenAI embeddings | Yes |
| local | Local embeddings | No |

## Source Options

- `memory` — MEMORY.md + memory/*.md files
- `sessions` — Past conversation transcripts
- `both` — Full context (recommended)

## Config Options Explained

| Setting | Purpose | Recommended |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| enabled | Turn on memory search | true |
| provider | Embedding provider | "voyage" |
| sources | What to index | ["memory", "sessions"] |
| indexMode | When to index | "hot" (real-time) |
| minScore | Relevance threshold | 0.3 (lower = more results) |
| maxResults | Max snippets returned | 20 |

## AGENTS.md Integration

Add to your AGENTS.md for agent behavior:

```markdown
## Memory Recall
Before answering questions about prior work, decisions, dates, people, preferences, or todos:
1. Run memory_search with relevant query
2. Use memory_get to pull specific lines if needed
3. If low confidence after search, say you checked
```

## Troubleshooting

### Memory search not working?
- Check memorySearch.enabled: true in config
- Verify MEMORY.md exists in workspace root
- Restart gateway: `openclaw gateway restart`

### Results not relevant?
- Lower minScore to 0.2 for more results
- Increase maxResults to 30
- Check that memory files have meaningful content

### Provider errors?
- Voyage: Set VOYAGE_API_KEY in environment
- OpenAI: Set OPENAI_API_KEY in environment
- Use local provider if no API keys available

## Verification

Test memory is working:

User: "What do you remember about [past topic]?"
Agent: [Should search memory and return relevant context]

## Why This Matters

Without memory:
- Agent forgets everything between sessions
- Repeats questions, loses context
- No continuity on projects

With memory:
- Recalls past conversations
- Knows your preferences
- Tracks project history
- Builds relationship over time
